OpenSSO Authentication Module for Information Cards (RP) Todo Items list

1 - Check compatibility / evaluate work to do to make authnicrp work on
    Distributed Authentication User Interface
2 - The Information Card / User Account association should be maintained in the
    identity repository in place of an external database (JavaDB). Extend IdRepo
    schema to support this association.
3 - Authicrp should be able to authenticate users against supported authentication
    data stores (i.e Active Directory)
4 - Information Card properties (required, optional claims, etc.) should be
    configurable on a realm / organization, Service URL basis
