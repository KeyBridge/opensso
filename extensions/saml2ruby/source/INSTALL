= Ruby SAML2 Library Installation

== Prerequisites
    * Ruby
    * RubyGems
    * Rails (for the example)

== Dependencies

This library depends on the Ruby XMLC14N-r library available at http://rubyforge.org/projects/c14n-r

download the .gem file and run 
gem install XMLCanonicalizer*
 
== SAML2 library Installation

run setup.rb to install:

 ruby setup.rb

setup.rb installs the library into your system ruby.  

If don't want to add ruby-saml2 to your system ruby, 
you may instead add the *lib* directory of the extracted tarball to your RUBYLIB environment variable:
  $ export RUBYLIB=${RUBYLIB}:/path/to/ruby-saml2/lib
  
or in the case of a rails application copy the library files to your rails application's lib directory.

== Testing the Installation

At the moment you have to use the example rails application to test:
 * Edit the saml2ruby/source/examples/rails/SimpleSAMLRP/app/controllers/account_controller.rb and change the SP and IdP settings to match your environment
 * run the rails server
 * Now browse to http://myserver.mydomain.com:myport/account
