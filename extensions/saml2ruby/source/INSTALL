= Ruby SAML2 Library Installation

== Dependencies

This library depends on the Ruby WSS4R library available at:

http://rubyforge.org/projects/wss4r

This library currently needs to by patched
Copy the patches/xmlcanonicalizer.rb file over the one installed by WSS4R
This is probably at: ruby\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\wss4r\security\util


== Manual Installation

Unpack the archive and run setup.rb to install:

 ruby setup.rb

setup.rb installs the library into your system ruby.  

If don't want to add ruby-saml2 to your system ruby, 
you may instead add the *lib* directory of the extracted tarball to your RUBYLIB environment variable:
  $ export RUBYLIB=${RUBYLIB}:/path/to/ruby-saml2/lib
  
or in the case of a rails application copy the library files to your rails application's lib directory.

== Testing the Installation

At the moment you have to use the example rails application to test
