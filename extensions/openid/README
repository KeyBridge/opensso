%% 1. Introduction

This is the 1.0 alpha1 version of the OpenID extension for OpenSSO. It
currently provides a provider implementation that is protocol compliant with
the OpenID Authentication 1.1 specification.

This is the first release in a planned series of releases. To see the roadmap
of releases, consult the docs/roadmap.txt file.

%% 2. Dependencies

This extension depends on the amserver product inside of OpenSSO, and in
turn, all of its dependencies.

%% 3. Before you build

Before you build the WAR file containing the OpenID extension, you must first
build the amserver WAR file. Build the war target in amserver.

This alpha1 release of the OpenID extension has a hard-coded OpenID
realm (URL scheme). You must change this scheme to match your OpenID identity
provider URL. Change the HARD_CODED_OPENID_REALM constant inside of the
com/sun/identity/openid/ProviderServlet.java file.

%% 4. Building the OpenID extension

The workspace build system offers different build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the workspace.
The default target that is executed is the usage target, which displays a
brief description about the other targets. Currently, the main targets
available in the workspace are:

  - clean : cleans any generated files
  - war   : builds the WAR
  - usage : displays this usage message

%% 4.1 clean target

The clean target removes all of the intermediate and output directories.

%% 4.2 war target

The war target extracts the amserver WAR file, compiles in the OpenID
extension, and packages it up as a new WAR file. A deployable WAR file will
be created under the openid/built/dist directory after this target is
successfully executed.

%% 4.3 usage target

Displays a list of available targets along with a brief description of each
available target for quick reference.
