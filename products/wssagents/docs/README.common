This README contains instructions on how to setup the common environment for Securing Web Services.

This document assumes that users have already done the following:

Follow the steps below to setup the common environment for Securing Web Services.

I. Modify resources/AMClient.properties as follows:

JAVA_HOME=/usr/java

# FAM Server Information
# Protocol can be either http or https
SERVER_PROTOCOL=amserver_protocol
SERVER_HOSTNAME=amserver_host
SERVER_PORT=amserver_port

# Application username and password
APPLICATION_USERNAME=amadmin
APPLICATION_PASSWORD=<amadmin password>

NAMING_URL=amserver_protocol://amserver_host:amserver_port/amserver/namingservice

# Debug information
DEBUG_LEVEL=error
DEBUG_DIR=/tmp/amclient

# Cookie information
AM_COOKIE_NAME=iPlanetDirectoryPro

# SAML xml signature keystore file, keystore password file,
# key password file and Liberty trusted CA aliases.
# path_to_file should be replaced by the appropriate value as below:
# /javaee.home/addons/accessmanager for installations of Java Application Platform SDK 
# (when Download or Download with JDK is selected), and /javaee.home/addons/amserver 
# for installations of Java Application Platform SDK or Java EE 5 SDK Update 1 
# (when Download with Tools is selected), and NetBeans Enterprise Pack 5.5 (when Download is selected).
SAML_KEYSTORE=/path_to_file/amclientkeystore.jks
SAML_STOREPASS=/path_to_file/.storepass
SAML_KEYAPSS=/path_to_file/.keypass
LIBERTY_TRUSTEDCA_ALIASES=amserver:<amserver_host>

# Login URL and Authentication service URL for Liberty use case
LOGIN_URL=amserver_protocol://amserver_host:amserver_port/amserver/UI/Login
LIBERTY_AUTHSVC_URL=amserver_protocol://amserver_host:amserver_port/amserver/Liberty/authnsvc

NOTE : The directory specified as a value for DEBUG_DIR in AMConfig.properties should be different 
than the one specified as the value for BASE_DIR in Installing Access Manager.
