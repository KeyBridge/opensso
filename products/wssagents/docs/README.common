This README contains instructions on how to setup the common environment for Securing Web Services.

This document assumes that users have already done the following:

1. Installed and configured the Federated Access Manager server. 


Follow the steps below to setup the common environment for Securing Web Services.

I. Modify resources/AMConfig.properties (from the exploded famwssproviders.zip) as follows:

# FAM Server Information
# Protocol can be either http or https
com.iplanet.am.server.protocol=famserver_protocol
com.iplanet.am.server.host=famserver_host
com.iplanet.am.server.port=famserver_port
com.iplanet.am.services.deploymentDescriptor=famserver_deploy_uri

# Application username and password
com.sun.identity.agents.app.username=amadmin
com.iplanet.am.service.password=<amadmin password>

com.iplanet.am.naming.url=famserver_protocol://famserver_host:famserver_port/famserver_deploy_uri/namingservice

# Debug information
com.iplanet.services.debug.level=message
com.iplanet.services.debug.directory=/tmp/amclient

# Cookie information
com.iplanet.am.cookie.name=iPlanetDirectoryPro

# SAML xml signature keystore file, keystore password file,
# key password file and Liberty trusted CA aliases.
# path_to_file should be replaced by the appropriate value as below:
# /javaee.home/addons/accessmanager for installations of Java Application Platform SDK 
# (when Download or Download with JDK is selected), and /javaee.home/addons/amserver 
# for installations of Java Application Platform SDK or Java EE 5 SDK Update 1 
# (when Download with Tools is selected), and NetBeans Enterprise Pack 5.5 (when Download is selected).
com.sun.identity.saml.xmlsig.keystore=/path_to_file/amclientkeystore.jks
com.sun.identity.saml.xmlsig.storepass=/path_to_file/.storepass
com.sun.identity.saml.xmlsig.keypass=/path_to_file/.keypass
com.sun.identity.liberty.ws.trustedca.certaliases=amserver:<famserver_host>

# Login URL and Authentication service URL for Liberty use case
com.sun.identity.loginurl=famserver_protocol://famserver_host:famserver_port/famserver_deploy_uri/UI/Login
com.sun.identity.liberty.authnsvc.url=famserver_protocol://famserver_host:famserver_port/famserver_deploy_uri/Liberty/authnsvc

NOTE : The directory specified as a value for DEBUG_DIR in AMConfig.properties should be different 
than the one specified as the value for BASE_DIR in Installing Access Manager.

II. Restart the Application Server.


III. Configure the web services client and the web services provider for Web services security.

1.  Login into the Federated Access Manager Console with user amadmin and <amadmin password>

         famserver_protocol://famserver_host:famserver_port/famserver_deploy_uri

Note: If you have logged in as any other user, click Logout on the console page and Login again and make sure that you access the Federated Access Manager Console.

2. Create "wsc" and "wsp" agent configurations using "famadm" cli, if not already created.
3. Pick up the opensso.zip from the build directory, and unzip it into a temp directory. There should be a file famAdminTools.zip. Create a directory for CLI and unzip the famAdminTools.zip into the directory.
4. In the CLI directory, do "setup -p <FAM config directory>".  The <FAM config directory> is the config directory you specified while configuring the opensso server.
5. The setup will create a directory called <famserver_deploy_uri>. cd to <famserver_deploy_uri>/bin to find admin tool "famadm".
6. Create WSCAgentConfiguration.properties and WSPAgentConfiguration.properties	files.
    Content of this properties file would look like this : 
    userpassword=<agent password>
    sunIdentityServerDeviceStatus=Active
    UserCredential=UserName:TestUser|UserPassword:TestUser
    SecurityMech=urn:sun:wss:security:null:UserNameToken
    
7. Create agent configuration using famadm:
    famadm create-agent -b wsc -t WSCAgent -u amadmin -f <amadmin user password file> -D WSCAgentConfiguration.properties
    famadm create-agent -b wsp -t WSPAgent -u amadmin -f <amadmin user password file> -D WSPAgentConfiguration.properties
8. Use "famadm show-agent -b <agent user name> -u amadmin -f <amadmin user password file> " to verify agent account has been created correctly.
