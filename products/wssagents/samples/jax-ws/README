%% 1. General Description

The samples provided here are JAX-WS based web service and a web services
client.

The sample demonstrates a simple stock quote service where given
a stock ticker symbol it obtains stock data. The secure communication
between stock quote web services client is achieved using 
OpenSSO web services security agents.

The following diagram depicts a simple deployment scenario where the 
profiles of WSC and WSP are all hosted on a single OpenSSO instance

%% 2. Build requirements

The OpenSSO Web Services Security Agents workspace uses Apache Ant as the build
tool. The build scripts in this workspace use features not present in releases 
of Ant prior to 1.6.  Thus, in order to build this workspace you must have 
Ant version 1.6.5 or above installed and available in your system path.
Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the Ant root directory, and add 
${ANT_HOME}/bin to your PATH environment variable.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 6.0 with the source
and target levels set to "1.6". In order to allow this, you must ensure that
JDK 6.0 is present in your system path and the JAVA_HOME environment variable
is setup correctly pointing to its location.

%% 3. Library dependencies

   3.1 Download the latest stable version of JAXWS Reference Implementation from
       http://jax-ws.dev.java.net. Execute the jar as
       java -jar <filename>.jar and copy the location of the lib
       folder, as the value of the "jaxws.lib" property, to the
       <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/jaxws.properties
       file for the Web Service Client and Web Service Provider.
   
%% 4. Building and Deploying the un-secured samples

The workspace build system offers many build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the
workspace. The default target that is executed is the usage target which
displays a brief description about the other targets. Currently the main
targets available in the workspace are:
 
     - clean              : Deletes all generated artifacts
     - generate-from-wsdl : Generates web-service stubs from wsdl to be used by 
                            the service and the client
     - compile            : Compiles all files in the project
     - prepare-to-build   : Copy all artifacts to the "web" folder to be
                            included in the WAR
     - war                : Creates the deployable WAR with no security
     - secure-war         : Creates the deployable WAR with security 
     - all                : Runs all the targets in the above order
     - usage              : Displays this usage message
 
The protocol, host and port number of the container where the WSP (StockService)
would be deployed, will need to be changed in 1 place.
	<wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockClient/src/com/sun/stockquote/
    GetQuote.java
	@WebServiceRef(wsdlLocation =
        "http://localhost:8080/StockService/StockService?wsdl")        

Then build the un-secure WARs by running "ant war" from
<wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockService for WSP and
<wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockClient for WSC.

The WARs generated above can be deployed on GlassFish 2.x, WebLogic 10.x,
JBoss 5.x, Tomcat 6.x & WebSphere 7.x.

NOTE: Except JBoss and Tomcat, all the other containers ship with JAXWS jars. 
Hence, no configuration change is needed to deploy the web-service on GlassFish, 
WebLogic & WebSphere. For special instructions on how to make Tomcat and JBoss
suitable for web-services, refer Sections 8 and 9 of this file.

%% 5. Building and Deploying the secured samples

   5.1 Modify the AMConfig.properties file found in <wssagents_unzip_location>/
       config/ folder as explained in the Step 2 of Section II A in the README
       file provided with the openssowssagents.zip download.
   5.2 Modify the <wssagents_unzip_location>/config/server_handlers.xml file by
       adding the LogServerHandler mapping to the handler chain as explained in
       Step 4 of section II B so that the final <wssagents_unzip_location>/
       config/server_handlers.xml has the following contents:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <handler-chains xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
                xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
                javaee_web_services_1_2.xsd">

        <handler-chain>
            <protocol-bindings>##SOAP11_HTTP</protocol-bindings>
            <handler>
                <handler-name>ServerHandler</handler-name>
                <handler-class>
                    com.sun.identity.wssagents.jaxws.server.ServerHandler
                </handler-class>
            </handler>
            <handler>
                <handler-name>LogServerHandler</handler-name>
                <handler-class>com.sun.stockquote.LogServerHandler</handler-class>
            </handler>
        </handler-chain>
       </handler-chains>

   5.3 Modify the <wssagents_unzip_location>/config/client_handlers.xml file by
       adding the LogClientHandler mapping to the handler chain as explained in
       Step 4 of section II C. The final version of <wssagents_unzip_location>
       /config/client_handlers.xml should be as shown here:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <handler-chains xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
                xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
                javaee_web_services_1_2.xsd">

        <handler-chain>
            <protocol-bindings>##SOAP11_HTTP</protocol-bindings>
            <handler>
                <handler-name>ClientHandler</handler-name>
                <handler-class>
                    com.sun.identity.wssagents.jaxws.client.ClientHandler
                </handler-class>
            </handler>
            <handler>
                <handler-name>LogServerHandler</handler-name>
                <handler-class>com.sun.stockquote.LogClientHandler</handler-class>
            </handler>
        </handler-chain>
       </handler-chains>

   5.4 Un-comment the following lines in the 
       <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockClient/web/WEB-INF/web.xml file -

       <filter>
      		<filter-name>LoginFilter</filter-name>
      		<filter-class>
      		  com.sun.identity.wssagents.jaxws.client.ClientFilter
      		</filter-class>
 	   </filter>
 	   <filter-mapping>
     		<filter-name>LoginFilter</filter-name>
     		<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
       </filter-mapping>

   5.5 Build the secure WARs by running "ant secure-war" from
       <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockService for WSP and
       <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockClient for WSC.
   5.6 Deployment instructions are same as for unsecure WAR.
   
%% 6. Configuring WSC and WSP profiles in OpenSSO

   By default, this sample will use the default WSC and WSP profiles that OpenSSO
   ships with (named as "wsc" and "wsp" respectively).
   If you wish to customize the configuration, you can create new
   Web Service Client and Web Service Provider profiles as explained here:

   Login into the OpenSSO Console with user amadmin and <amadmin password>

   openssoserver_protocol://openssoserver_host:openssoserver_port/
                                                        openssoserver_deploy_uri

   Note: If you have logged in as any other user, click Logout on the console
         page and Login again and make sure that you access the OpenSSO Console.

   Go to Access Control -> Default realm -> Agents ->

   6.1 Create "WSC" profile
       6.1.1 Select Web Service Client -> under Agent, click "new" ->
       6.1.2 Enter name as "StockService" (Service Name from the Service WSDL)
             and other required fields and click Save.
       6.1.3 Click on above saved profile to edit ->
       6.1.4 Select required Security Mechanism.
       6.1.5 Check "Is Request Signed" as true.
       6.1.6 Enter "Web Service End Point" as
             "<protocol>://<host>:<port>/StockService/StockService".
       6.1.7 Save changes.

       Note : If the required or selected Security Mechanism is "STSSecurity", 
              then select STS Configuration as "SecurityTokenService".

   6.2 Create "WSP" profile
       6.2.1 Select Web Service Provider -> under Agent, click "new" ->
       6.2.2 Enter name as "<protocol>://<host>:<port>/StockService/StockService"
             (your Web Service End Point URL) and other required fields and
              click Save.
       6.2.3 Click on above saved profile to edit ->
       6.2.4 Select all Security Mechanisms.
       6.2.5 Check "Is Request Signature Verified" as true.
       6.2.6 Enter "Web Service End Point" as
             "<protocol>://<host>:<port>/StockService/StockService".
       6.2.7 Save changes.

   6.3 Update "Agent Authenticator" profile
       6.3.1 Select Agent Authenticator -> under Agent, click on "agentAuth" ->
       6.3.2 Under "Agent Profiles allowed to Read",
             Select newly created agent profiles for WSC and WSP
             ("StockService" and "<protocol>://<host>:<port>/StockService/
               StockService")
             from "Available" list in order to add them to be in "Selected" list.
       6.3.3 Save changes.

   Save the changes and logout of OpenSSO.

%% 7. Testing the samples

   7.1 From your web browser, access <protocol>://<host>:<port>/StockClient
   7.2 With unsecure WARs, you should be directed to the page with a simple
       form to enter the Stock Symbol of your choice. Click Get Quote button.
       The web-service provider should return the stock results. On this page,
       click on the links named Request and Response in the image illustrating
       the communication. You should see the SOAP request and response without
       any security token in the SOAP request/response headers.
   7.3 With the secure WARs, you will be redirected to OpenSSO's Authentication 
       service for end user login. Enter any existing OpenSSO user with the 
       password. Upon successful end user authentication, you will be redirected 
       back to <protocol>://<host>:<port>/StockClient/ page. Click Get Quote for
       a symbol of your choice and by clicking on the Request/Response links on
       the stock quote results page, you can see the security token in the SOAP
       request/response headers.
   7.4 Repeat the steps from 7.2
   
%% 8. Building the samples for Tomcat

   8.1 To make Tomcat 6.x JAX-WS aware, edit the <TOMCAT_HOME>/conf/
       catalina.properties file and set the shared.loader property as shown:

       shared.loader=<jaxws_install_location>/lib/*.jar

       If you are running multiple instances of Tomcat, then edit CATALINA_BASE/
       conf/catalina.properties for that particular instance.

   8.2 Web Service WAR

   8.2.1 Because Tomcat is a Web Container (not a Java EE container) and
         does not support JSR 109 service endpoint, the JAX-WS service WAR 
         deployed in Tomcat needs a special deployment descriptor. This 
         descriptor is the XML file - <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/etc/
         Tomcat/StockService/sun-jaxws.xml. The file describes
         the JAX-WS service endpoint, and must be copied to
         <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockService/web/WEB-INF/ folder.
   8.2.2 Replace the <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockService/web/WEB-INF/
         web.xml file with <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/etc/
         Tomcat/StockService/web.xml file.
   8.2.3 Create the StockService.war file, incorporating the above changes, by
         running "ant secure-war" from <wssagents_unzip_location>/
         samples/StockService and deploy using the Tomcat admin console or by
         copying the files into the <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps directory.

   8.3 Web Service Client WAR

   8.3.1 On the client side, <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockClient/src/
         com/sun/stockquote/GetQuote.java must be replaced with
         <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/etc/Tomcat/StockClient/GetQuote.java.
         The @WebServiceRef and @HandlerChain annotations are not supported by 
         Tomcat and hence, the jax-ws handler chain needs to be invoked 
         programmatically by making the required changes to the implementation 
         class.
   8.3.2 After copying the Tomcat specific GetQuote.java, remember to update the
         protocol, host and port number of the container where the WSP 
         (StockService) is deployed, in the WSDL URL (shown in the snippet below)

         wsdlLocation = new URL("http://localhost:8080/StockService/" +
                    "StockService?wsdl");

   8.3.3 Run "ant secure-war" from <wssagents_unzip_location>/samples/StockClient
         and deploy the resulting StockClient.war using the Tomcat admin console
         or by copying the files into the <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps directory.

%% 9. Preparing JBoss for JAX-WS

   9.1 Download JBossWS, the JBoss Web Services stack (Metro/Apache CXF version 
       3.1.1.GA). The version of JBossWS needed depends on the version of JBoss
       Application Server that you are running.
   9.2 To install the stack downloaded in the previous step, unzip the 
       downloaded file and modify the file ant.properties.example by providing
       the JBOSS_HOME value based on the version of JBoss you are using. All the
       other values can be left to default. Save the file as ant.properties in
       the same location.
   9.3 Run the ant target deploy-jbossxxx where xxx is the version of JBoss. 
       For example, if you are using JBoss 5.0.0.GA, the command would be:
       ant deploy-jboss500
       Refer to the JBoss website for detailed installation instructions.
   
%% 10. Pre-Built WAR Files

The Sample WARs shipped with the WSS Agents Sample assume that the WSP is
deployed to a container running at localhost using port 8080. If your setup 
matches this, you can test the WARs directly, without the need of building 
from scratch. If you are using Tomcat, you will need to follow Step 8 to create
Tomcat specific WAR files.
