starting point is Entities under the Federation interface.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>You may also modify defined Common Attributes from this screen.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><b>Click on the name of a configured affiliate entity to modify its profile.</b><p>The entity's profile page is displayed.</p></li>
<li><b>Select Affiliate from the View menu.</b></li>
<li><b>Select any of the available entities to assign to the affiliation.</b></li>
<li><b>Modify values for the Common Attributes.</b><p>Common Attributes contain values that generally define the identity provider itself.</p><dl><dt>Name</dt>
<dd><p>Type a new URI for the affiliation, if applicable. The current value of this attribute is the URI assigned to the Affiliate Name attribute when you created the entity. Any new value must be unique among affiliate names.</p></dd>
<dt>Owner</dt>
<dd><p>Type a new URI to define a different owner or parent operator for the affiliation. The current value of this attribute is the URI assigned to the Affiliate Owner attribute when you created the entity. The new value for this attribute is a URI that would match the value defined in the Entity Name attribute of the entity to which the new owner/provider belongs. Any new value must be unique among affiliate names.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Defining a provider as the Affiliate Owner does not automatically include it as a member of the affiliation. If an owner is also a member, the URI must be defined here as the owner and within the affiliate entity itself as a member.</p>
