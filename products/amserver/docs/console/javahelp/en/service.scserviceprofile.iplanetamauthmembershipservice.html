<a name="service.scserviceprofile.iplanetamauthmembershipservice"></a><h4>Membership</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-182"></a>The Membership Authentication module is implemented for personalized sites. When membership authentication is
enabled, a user can self-register. This means the user can create an account, personalize
it, and access it as a registered user without the help of an
administrator. The attributes are realm attributes. The attributes are:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#fumys">Minimum Password Length</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fumyr">Default User Roles</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fumyt">User Status After Registration</a></p></li>

<a name="fumys"></a><h5>Minimum Password Length</h5>
<p>Specifies the minimum number of characters required for a password set during self-registration.
The default value is 8.</p><p>If this value is changed, it should also be changed in the
registration and error text in the following file:</p><p><tt></tt><i>AcessManager-base</i><tt>/locale/amAuthMembership.properties</tt>  (<i>PasswdMinChars</i> entry)</p>

<a name="fumyr"></a><h5>Default User Roles</h5>
<p>Specifies the roles assigned to new users whose profiles are created through self-registration.
There is no default value. The administrator must specify the DNs of the
roles that will be assigned to the new user.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The role specified must be under the realm for which authentication is being
configured. Only the roles that can be assigned to the user will be
added during self-registration. All other DNs will be ignored. The role can be
either an Federated Access Manager role or an LDAP role, but filtered roles
are not accepted.</p>
<hr>


<a name="fumyt"></a><h5>User Status After Registration</h5>
<p>Specifies whether services are immediately made available to a user who has self-registered.
The default value is Active and services are available to the new user.
By selecting Inactive, the administrator chooses to make no services available to a
new user.</p>

<a name="fumzt"></a><h5>Primary LDAP Server</h5>
<p>Specifies the host name and port number of the primary LDAP server specified
during Federated Access Manager installation. This is the first server contacted for authentication.
The format is<tt></tt><i>hostname:port</i><tt></tt>. If there is no port number, assume <tt>389</tt>.</p><p>If you have Federated Access Manager deployed with multiple domains, you can specify
the communication link between specific instances of Federated Access Manager and Directory Server
in the following format (multiple entries must be prefixed by the local server
name):</p><p><tt>local_servername|server:port local_servername2|server2:port2 ...</tt></p><p>For example, if you have two Federated Access Manager instances deployed in different
locations (L1-machine1-IS and L2- machine2-IS) communicating with different instances of Directory Server (L1-machine1-DS and
L2-machine2-DS), it would look the following:</p><p><tt>L1-machine1-IS.example.com|L1-machine1-DS.example.com:389</tt></p><p><tt>L2-machine2-IS.example.com|L2-machine2-DS.example.com:389</tt></p>

<a name="fumza"></a><h5>Secondary LDAP Server</h5>
<p>Specifies the host name and port number of a secondary LDAP server available
to the Federated Access Manager platform. If the primary LDAP server does not
respond to a request for authentication, this server would then be contacted. If
the primary server is up, Federated Access Manager will switch back to the
primary server. The format is also <tt></tt><i>hostname:port</i><tt></tt>. Multiple entries must be prefixed by the
local server name.</p>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>When authenticating users from a Directory Server that is remote from the Federated
Access Manager enterprise, it is important that both the Primary and Secondary LDAP
Server Ports have values. The value for one Directory Server location can be
used for both fields.</p>
<hr>


<a name="fumyz"></a><h5>DN to Start User Search</h5>
<p>Specifies the DN of the node where the search for a user
would start. (For performance reasons, this DN should be as specific as possible.) The
default value is the root of the directory tree. Any valid DN will
be recognized. If OBJECT is selected in the Search Scope attribute, the DN
should specify one level above the level in which the profile exists. Multiple
entries must be prefixed by the local server name. The format is <tt></tt><i>servername|search dn</i><tt></tt>.</p><p>For multiple entries:</p><p><tt></tt><i>servername1|search dn servername2|search dn servername3|search dn</i><tt>...</tt></p><p>If multiple entries exist under the root organization with the same user ID,
then this parameter should be set so that the only one entry can
be searched for or found in order to be authenticated. For example, in
the case where the agent ID and user ID is same under root
org, this parameter should be <tt>ou=Agents</tt> for the root organization to authenticate using
Agent ID and <tt>ou=People,</tt> for the root organization to authenticate using User
ID.</p>

<a name="fumzb"></a><h5>DN for Root User Bind</h5>
<p>Specifies the DN of the user that will be used to bind
to the Directory Server specified in the Primary LDAP Server and Port field as
administrator. The authentication service needs to bind as this DN in order to
search for a matching user DN based on the user login ID. The
default is <tt>amldapuser.</tt> Any valid DN will be recognized.</p>

<a name="fumze"></a><h5>Password for Root User Bind</h5>
<p>Carries the password for the administrator profile specified in the DN for Root
User Bind field. There is no default value. Only the administrator's valid LDAP
password will be recognized.</p>

<a name="fumzd"></a><h5>Password for Root User Bind (confirm)</h5>
<p>Confirmation of the password.</p>

<a name="fumzc"></a><h5>Attribute Used to Retrieve User Profile</h5>
<p>Specifies the attribute used for the naming convention of user entries. By default,
Federated Access Manager assumes that user entries are identified by the uid attribute.
If your Directory Server uses a different attribute (such as <i>givenname</i>) specify the attribute
name in this field.</p>

<a name="fumzh"></a><h5>Attributes Used to Search for a User to be Authenticated</h5>
<p>Lists the attributes to be used to form the search filter for a
user that is to be authenticated, and allows the user to authenticate with
more than one attribute in the user's entry. For example, if this field
is set to <i>uid</i>, <i>employeenumber</i> , and <i>mail</i>, the user could authenticate with
any of these names.</p>

<a name="fumzg"></a><h5>User Search Filter</h5>
<p>Specifies an attribute to be used to find the user under the DN
to Start User Search field. It works with the User Naming Attribute. There
is no default value. Any valid user entry attribute will be recognized.</p>

<a name="fumzj"></a><h5>Search Scope</h5>
<p>Indicates the number of levels in the Directory Server that will be searched
for a matching user profile. The search begins from the node specified in
the attribute "DN to Start User Search" on page 315. The default value
is SUBTREE. One of the following choices can be selected from the list:</p><dl><dt>OBJECT</dt>
<dd><p>Searches only the specified node.</p></dd>
<dt>ONELEVEL</dt>
<dd><p>Searches at the level of the specified node and one level down.</p></dd>
<dt>SUBTREE</dt>
<dd><p>Search all entries at and below the specified node.</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="fumzi"></a><h5>Enable SSL to Access LDAP Server</h5>
<p>Enables SSL access to the Directory Server specified in the Primary and Secondary
LDAP Server and Port field. By default, the box is not checked and
the SSL protocol will not be used to access the Directory Server.</p><p>If the LDAP Server is running with SSL enabled (LDAPS), you must make
sure that Federated Access Manager is configured with proper SSL trusted certificates so
that AM could connect to Directory server over LDAPS protocol</p>

<a name="fumzk"></a><h5>Return User DN to Authenticate</h5>
<p>When the Federated Access Manager directory is the same as the directory configured
for LDAP, this option may be enabled. If enabled, this option allows the
LDAP authentication module to return the DN instead of the User ID, and
no search is necessary. Normally, an authentication module returns only the User ID,
and the authentication service searches for the user in the local Federated Access
Manager LDAP. If an external LDAP directory is used, this option is typically
not enabled.</p>

<a name="fumzm"></a><h5>Authentication Level</h5>
<p>The authentication level is set separately for each method of authentication. The value
indicates how much to trust an authentication mechanism. Once a user has authenticated,
this value is stored in the SSO token for the session. When the
SSO token is presented to an application the user wants to access, the
application uses the stored value to determine whether the level is sufficient to
grant the user access. If the authentication level stored in an SSO token does
not meet the minimum value required, the application can prompt the user to
authenticate again through a service with a higher authentication level. The default value
is 0.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>If no authentication level is specified, the SSO token stores the value specified
in the Core Authentication attribute <a href="service.scserviceprofile.iplanetamauthservice.html#fwbfn">Default Authentication Level</a>.</p>
