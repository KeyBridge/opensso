<a name="ghfif"></a><h4>Agent Authenticator</h4>
<p>An agent authenticator is a type of agent that, once it is
authenticated, can obtain the read-only data of agent profiles that are selected for the
agent authenticator to read. The agent profiles can be of any type (J2EE,
WSP, Discovery, and so forth), but must exist in the same realm. Users
that have the agent's authentication credentials (username and password) can read the agent
profile data, but do not have the create, update, or delete permissions of
the Agent Admin. </p><p>The agent Authenticator contains the following attributes:</p>

<a name="ghfjs"></a><h5>Group</h5>
<p>The Group mechanism allows you to define a collection of similar types of
agents. The group must be defined before including the particular agent into a
collection. </p>

<a name="ghfjj"></a><h5>Password</h5>
<p>The password was set when you created the agent profile. However, you can
change the password at any time in the future.</p>

<a name="ghfiu"></a><h5>Password Confirm</h5>
<p>The confirmation of the password was performed when you created the agent profile.
If you change the password, you must confirm the change.</p>

<a name="ghfka"></a><h5>Status</h5>
<p>The <tt>Active</tt> option is selected when the agent is created. Choose <tt>Inactive</tt> only
if you want to remove the protection the agent provides.</p>

<a name="ghfig"></a><h5>Agent Profiles Allowed to Read</h5>
<p>This attribute defines a list of OpenSSO agents whose profile data the agent
authenticator can read. The agents can be of any type (J2EE, WSP, Discovery,
and so forth), but must exist in the same realm. To add an
agent to the list, enter the agent name in the New Value field
and click Add.</p>
