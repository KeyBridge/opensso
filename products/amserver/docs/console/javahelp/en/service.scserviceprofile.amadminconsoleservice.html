<A NAME="fufly"></A><h4>Federation Management</h4>
<p>Enables Federation Management. It is selected by default. To disable this feature,
deselect the field The Federation Management tab will not appear in the console.</p>
<A NAME="fsvge"></A><h4>User Management</h4>
<p>Enables User Management. This is enabled by default. This attribute is applicable
when Access Manager is installed in legacy mode. </p>
<A NAME="fsvgj"></A><h4>People Containers</h4>
<p> This attribute is deselected by default and is applicable only when Access
Manager is installed in legacy mode. Selecting this attribute will display people
containers under the Directory Management tab. It is recommended that you use a single
people container in your DIT and then use roles to manage accounts and services. The
default behavior of the Access Manager console is to hide the People Containers. However,
if you have multiple people containers in your DIT, select this attribute to display
People Containers as managed objects. </p>
<A NAME="fsvgm"></A><h4>Organizational Unit Containers</h4>
<p> This attribute is deselected by default and is applicable when Access Manager
is installed in legacy mode. Selecting this attribute will display containers in the
Directory Management tab.</p>
<A NAME="fsvgq"></A><h4>Group Containers</h4>
<p> This attribute is deselected by default and is applicable when Access Manager
is installed in legacy mode. Selecting this attribute will display group containers
in the Directory Management tab.</p>
<A NAME="fsvgh"></A><h4>Managed Group Type</h4>
<p>Specifies whether subscription groups created through the console are static
or dynamic. The console will either create and display subscription groups that are
static or dynamic, not both. (Filtered groups are always supported regardless of the
value given to this attribute.) The default value is dynamic.  </p>
<ul><li><p>A static group explicitly lists each group member using the <tt>groupOfNames</tt> or <tt>groupOfUniqueNames</tt> object class.
The group entry contains the <i>uniqueMember</i> attribute for each
member of the group. Members of static groups are manually added; the user entry itself
remains unchanged. Static groups are suitable for groups with few members. </p>
</li>
<li><p>A dynamic group uses a <tt>memberOf</tt> attribute in the entry
of each group member. Members of dynamic groups are generated through the use of an
LDAP filter which searches and returns all entries which contain the <tt>memberOf</tt> attribute. Dynamic groups are suitable for groups that have a very large
membership. </p>
</li>
<li><p>A filtered group uses an LDAP filter to search and return members
that meet the requirement of the filter. For instance, the filter can generate members
with a specific uid (<tt>uid=g*</tt>) or email address (<tt>mail=*@example.com</tt>). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the examples above, the LDAP filter would return all users whose uid begins
with <tt>g</tt> or whose email address ends with <tt>example.com</tt>,
respectively. Filtered groups can only be created within the User Management view
by choosing Membership by Filter.</p>
<p>  An administrator can select one of the following: </p>
<ul><li><p>Dynamic - Groups created through the Membership
By Subscription option will be dynamic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Static - Groups created through the Membership
By Subscription option will be static.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="fsvgr"></A><h4>Default Role Permissions </h4>
<p>Defines a list of default access control instructions (ACIs) or <i>permissions</i> that are used to grant administrator privileges when creating new roles.
Select one of these ACIs for the level of privilege you wish. Access Manager ships
with four default role permissions: </p>
<p>No Permissions -- No permissions are to be set
on the role. </p>
<p>Organization Admin -- The Organization Administrator
has read and write access to all entries in the configured organization.  </p>
<p>Organization Help Desk Admin -- The Organization
Help Desk Administrator has read access to all entries in the configured organization
and write access to the <tt>userPassword</tt> attribute.  </p>
<p>Organization Policy Admin -- The Organization
Policy Administrator has read and write access to all policies in the realm. The Organization
Policy Administrator can not create a referral policy.  	</p>
<A NAME="fsvgt"></A><h4>Domain Component Tree</h4>
<p>The Domain Component tree (DC tree) is a specific DIT structure used by many
Sun Java System components to map between DNS names and realm entries.  </p>
<p>When this option is enabled, the DC tree entry for an realm is created, provided
that the DNS name of the realm is entered at the time the realm is created. The DNS
name field will appear in the <b>realm Create</b> page. This option
is only applicable to top-level realms, and will not be displayed for subrealms. </p>
<p>Any status change made to the <i>inetdomainstatus</i> attribute
through the Access Manager SDK in the realm tree will update the corresponding DC
tree entry status. (Updates to status that are not made through the Access Manager
SDK will not be synchronized.) For example, if a new realm, sun, is created with the
DNS name attribute <tt>sun.com</tt>, the following entry will be created
in the DC tree: </p>
<p><tt>dc=sun,dc=com,o=internet,root suffix</tt> </p>
<p>The DC tree may optionally have its own root suffix configured by setting <tt>com.iplanet.am.domaincomponent</tt> in <tt>AMConfig.properties</tt>.
By default, this is set to the Access Manager root. If a different suffix is desired,
this suffix must be created using LDAP commands. The ACIs for administrators that
create realms required modification so that they have unrestricted access to the new
DC tree root.</p>
<A NAME="fsvgs"></A><h4>Administrative Groups</h4>
<p>Specifies whether to create the DomainAdministrators and DomainHelpDeskAdministrators
groups. If enabled, these groups are created and associated with the Organization
Admin Role and Organization Help Desk Admin Role, respectively. Once created, adding
or removing a user to one of these associated roles automatically adds or removes
the user from the corresponding group. This behavior, however, does not work in reverse.
Adding or removing a user to one of these groups will not add or remove the user in
the user's associated roles.  </p>
<p>The DomainAdministrators and DomainHelpDeskAdministrators groups are only created
in realms that are created after this option is enabled.  	</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note - </b>This option does not apply to subrealms, with the exception of the root
realm. At the root realm, the ServiceAdministrators and ServiceHelpDesk Administrators
groups are created and associated with the Top-level Admin and Top-level Help Desk
Admin roles, respectively. The same behavior applies.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p><A NAME="fsvgv"></A><h4>Compliance User Deletion</h4>
<p>Specifies whether a user's entry will be deleted, or just marked as deleted,
from the directory. This attribute is only applicable when Access Manager is installed
in legacy mode.</p>
<p>When a user's entry is deleted and this option is selected (true), the user's
entry will still exist in the directory, but will be marked as deleted. User entries
that are marked for deletion are not returned during Directory Server searches. If
this option is not selected, the user's entry will be deleted from the directory.</p>
<A NAME="fsvgu"></A><h4>Dynamic Administrative Roles ACIs</h4>
<p>This attribute defines the access control instructions for the administrator
roles that are created dynamically when a group or realm is configured using Access
Manager. These roles are used for granting administrative privileges for the specific
grouping of entries created. The default ACIs can be modified only under this attribute
listing.  </p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note - </b>Administrators at the Organization level have a wider scope of access
than do group administrators. But, by default, when a user is added to a group administrator
role, that user can change the password of anyone in the group. This would include
any organization administrator who is a member of that group.  </p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p><p>The Container Help Desk Admin role has read access to all
entries in an organizational unit and write access to the <i>userPassword</i> attribute in user entries only in this container unit.  </p>
<p>The Organization Help Desk Admin has read access
to all entries in an organization and write access to the <i>userPassword</i> attribute.   	When a suborganization is created, remember that the administration
roles are created in the suborganization, not in the parent organization.  </p>
<p>The Container Admin role has read and write access
to all entries in an LDAP organizational unit. In Access Manager, the LDAP organizational
unit is often referred to as a container.  </p>
<p>The Organization Policy Administrator has read and
write access to all policies, and can create, assign, modify, and delete all policies
within that organization.  </p>
<p>ThePeople Container Admin  is by default, any user
entry in an newly created realm is a member of that organization's People Container.
The People Container Administrator has read and write access to all user entries in
the organization's People Container. Keep in mind that this role DOES NOT have read
and write access to the attributes that contain role and group DNs therefore, they
cannot modify the attributes of, or remove a user from, a role or a group.  </p>
<p>Other containers can be configured with Access Manager to hold user entries,
group entries or even other containers. To apply an Administrator role to a container
created after the organization has already been configured, the Container Admin Role
or Container Help Desk Admin defaults would be used.  </p>
<p>The Group Admin has read and write access to all
members of a specific group, and can create new users, assign users to the groups
they manage, and delete the users the that they have created.  When a group is created,
the Group Administrator role is automatically generated with the necessary privileges
to manage the group. The role is not automatically assigned to a group member. It
must be assigned by the group's creator, or anyone that has access to the Group Administrator
Role. </p>
<p>The Top-level Admin has read and write access to
all entries in the top-level organization. In other words, this Top-level Admin role
has privileges for every configuration principal within the Access Manager application.
 </p>
<p>The Organization Administrator has read and write
access to all entries in an organization. When an organization is created, the Organization
Admin role is automatically generated with the necessary privileges to manage the
organization.  </p>
<p></p>
<A NAME="ftbxa"></A><h4>User Profile Service Classes</h4>
<p>Lists the services that will have a custom display in the User Profile page.
The default display generated by the console may not be sufficient for some services.
This attribute creates a custom display for any service, giving full control over
what and how the service information is displayed. The syntax is as follows: </p>
<p><tt>service name | relative url()</tt> </p>
<p>Services that are listed in this attribute will not display in the User Create
pages. Any data configuration for a custom service display must be performed the User
Profile pages.</p>
<A NAME="fsvgw"></A><h4>DC Node Attribute List</h4>
<p>Defines the set of attributes that will be set in the DC tree entry when an
object is created. The default parameters are: </p>

See the note under Groups People Container List attribute for the People Container
fallback order.</p>
<A NAME="fsvha"></A><h4>Groups People Container List</h4>
<p>Specifies a list of People Containers from which a Group Administrator can choose
when creating a new user. This list can be used if there are multiple People Containers
in the directory tree. (If no People Containers are specified in this list or in the
Groups Default People Container field, users are created in the default Access Manager
people container,  <tt>ou=people</tt>.) There is no default value for this
field. </p>
<p>The syntax for this attribute is:</p>
<p> <tt></tt><i>dn of group<tt></i> | </tt><i>dn of people
container<tt></i></tt>  	</p>
<p>When a user is created, this attribute is checked for a container in which to
place the entry. If the attribute is empty, the <b>Groups Default People Container</b> attribute is checked for a container. If the latter attribute is empty,
the entry is created under <tt>ou=people</tt>.</p>
<p>This attribute is only applicable when Access Manager is installed in legacy
mode. There is no default value.</p>

Profile page shows the user's roles only for administrators.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhj"></A><h4>Show Groups on User Profile Page</h4>
<p>Specifies whether to display a list of groups assigned to a user as part of
the user's User Profile page. If this parameter is not enabled (the default), the
User Profile page shows the user's groups only for administrators. </p>
<A NAME="fsvhf"></A><h4>User Self Subscription to Group</h4>
<p>This parameter specifies whether users can add themselves to groups that are
open to subscription. If the parameter is not enabled (the default), the user profile
page allows the user's group membership to be modified only by an administrator. This
parameter applies only when the Show <b>Groups on User Profile Page</b> option
is selected.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhk"></A><h4>User Profile Display Options</h4>
<p>This menu specifies which service attributes will be displayed in the user profile
page. An administrator can select from the following: </p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="5"><tr valign="top"><td>UserOnly</td><td><p>Display viewable User schema attributes for services assigned to the
user. User service attribute values are viewable by the user when the attribute contains
the keyword Display. See the Access Manager Developer's Guide for details.</p>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Combined</td><td><p>Display viewable User and Dynamic schema attributes for services assigned
to the user.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<A NAME="fsvhl"></A><h4>User Creation Default Roles</h4>
<p>This listing defines roles that will be assigned to newly created users automatically.
There is no default value. An administrator can input the DN of one or more roles.
 	</p>
<p>This field only takes a full Distinguished Name address, not a role name. The
roles can only be Access Manager roles, not LDAP (Directory Server) roles.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhm"></A><h4>Administrative Console Tabs</h4>
<p>This field lists the Java classes of modules that will be displayed at the top
of the console. The syntax is <tt>i18N key | java class name</tt>. </p>
<p>The i18N key is used for the localized name of the entry in the console.</p>
<A NAME="fsvho"></A><h4>Maximum Results Returned From Search</h4>
<p>This field defines the maximum number of results returned from a search. The
default value is 100.  	</p>
<p>Do not set this attribute to a large value (greater than 1000) unless sufficient
system resources are allocated.</p>
<p>Modifications to this attribute done through <tt>LDAPModify</tt> will
take precedence to those made through the Access Manager Console. For more information
on changing this attribute using <tt>LDAPModify</tt>, see the Access Manager
Developer's Guide.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhp"></A><h4>Timeout For Search</h4>
<p>Defines the amount of time (in number of seconds) that a search will continue
before timing out. It is used to stop potentially long searches. After the maximum
search time is reached, the search terminates and returns an error. The default is
5 seconds.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhs"></A><h4>JSP Directory Name</h4>
<p> Specifies the name of the directory that contains the JSP files for an organization.
It allows administrator to have different appearance (customization) for different
organization. The default value for this attribute is <tt>console</tt>.
This attribute is applicable only when Access Manager is installed in legacy mode. </p>
<A NAME="fsvhr"></A><h4>Online Help Documents</h4>
<p>This field lists the online help links that will be created on the main Access
Manager help page. This allows other applications to add their online help links in
the Access Manager page. The format for this attribute is: </p>
<p><tt>linki18nkey | html page to load | i18n properties file | remote server</tt>  	</p>
<p>The remote server attribute is an optional argument that allows you to specify
the remote server on which the online help document is located. The default value
is:</p>
<p><tt>DSAME Help|/contents.html|amAdminModlueMsgs</tt></p>
<p>This attribute is only applicable when Access Manager is installed in legacy
mode.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhq"></A><h4>Required Services</h4>
<p>This field lists the services that are dynamically added to the users' entries
when they are created. Administrators can choose which services are added at the time
of creation.  This attribute is not used by the console, but by the Access Manager
SDK. Users that are dynamically created and created by the <tt>amadmin</tt> command
line utility will be assigned the services listed in this attribute.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhu"></A><h4>User Search Key</h4>
<p>This attribute defines the attribute name that is to be searched upon when performing
a simple search in the Navigation page. The default value for this attribute is <tt>cn</tt>. </p>
<p>For example, if you enter<tt> j*</tt> in the Name field in the Navigation
frame, users whose names begins with "j" or "J" will be displayed.</p>
<A NAME="fsvht"></A><h4>User Search Return Attribute</h4>
<p>This field defines the attribute name used when displaying the users returned
from a simple search. The default of this attribute is uid cn. This will display the
user ID and the user's full name. </p>
<p>The attribute name that is listed first is also used as the key for sorting
the set of users that will be returned. To avoid performance degradation, use an attribute
whose value is set in a user's entry.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhv"></A><h4>User Creation Notification List</h4>
<p>This field defines a list of email addresses that will be sent notification
when a new user is created. Multiple email addresses can be specified, as in the following
syntax:</p>
<p><tt> e-mail|locale|charset </tt></p>
<p><tt>e-mail|locale|charset </tt></p>
<p><tt>e-mail|locale|charset</tt> </p>
<p>The notification list also accepts different locales by using the <tt>-|locale</tt> option. </p>
<p>See <A HREF="supportedlang.html#supportedlang">Supported Language Locales</A>for a
list of locales.  	</p>
<p>The sender email ID can be changed by modifying property 497 in <tt>amProfile.properties</tt>, which is located, by default, at <tt></tt><i>AccessManager-base<tt></i>/SUNWam/locale</tt>.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhw"></A><h4>User Deletion Notification List</h4>
<p>This field defines a list of email addresses that will be sent notification

<p>The sender email ID can be changed by modifying property 497 in <tt>amProfile.properties</tt>, which is located, by default, at <tt></tt><i>AccessManager-base<tt></i>/SUNWam/locale</tt>.</p>
<p>The default sender ID is <tt>DSAME</tt>.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhx"></A><h4>User Modification Notification List</h4>
<p>Defines a list of attributes and email addresses associated with the attribute.
When a user modification occurs on an attribute defined in the list, the email address
associated with the attribute will be sent notification. Each attribute can have a
different set of addresses associated to it. Multiple email address can be specified,
as in the following syntax:</p>
<p> <tt>attrName </tt><i>e-mail<tt></i>|</tt><i>locale<tt></i>|</tt><i>charset<tt></i> </tt><i>e-mail<tt></i>|</tt><i>locale<tt></i>|</tt><i>charset<tt></i> ..... </tt></p>
<p> <tt>attrName </tt><i>e-mail<tt></i>|</tt><i>locale<tt></i>|</tt><i>charset<tt></i> </tt><i>e-mail<tt></i>|</tt><i>locale<tt></i>|</tt><i>charset<tt></i> ..... </tt></p>
<p>The <tt>-self</tt> keyword may be used in place of one of the addresses.
This sends mail to the user whose profile was modified.  For example, assume the following:</p>
<p> <tt>manager someuser@sun.com|self|admin@sun.com</tt> </p>
<p>Mail will be sent to the address specified in the manager attribute, <tt>someuser@sun.com</tt>, <tt>admin@sun</tt>, the person who modified
the user (self). </p>
<p>The notification list also accepts different locales by using the <tt>-|locale</tt> option. For example, to send the notification to an administrator in France: </p>
<p><tt>manager someuser@sun.com|self|admin@sun.com|fr</tt> See<A HREF="supportedlang.html#supportedlang">Supported Language Locales</A> for a list of locales.
 	</p>
<p>The attribute name is the same as it appears in the Directory Server schema,
and not as the display name in the console.</p>
<A NAME="fsvia"></A><h4>Maximum Entries Displayed per Page</h4>
<p>This attribute allows you to define the maximum rows that can be displayed per
page. The default is 25. For example, if a user search returns 100 rows, there will
be 4 pages with 25 rows displayed in each page.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhz"></A><h4>Event Listener Classes</h4>
<p>This attribute contains a list of listeners that receive creation, modification
and deletion events from the Access Manager console.</p>
<A NAME="fsvhy"></A><h4>Pre and Post Processing Classes</h4>
<p>This field defines a list of implementation classes through plug-ins that extend
the <tt>com.iplanet.am.sdk.AMCallBack</tt> class to receive callbacks
during pre and post processing operations for users, realm, roles and groups. The
operations are:</p>
<ul><li><p>create</p>
</li>
<li><p>delete</p>
</li>
<li><p>modify</p>
</li>
<li><p>add users to roles/groups</p>
</li>
<li><p>delete users from roles/groups</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must enter the full class name of the plug-in and then change the class
path of your web container (from the Access Manager installation base) to include
the full path to the location of the plug-in class</p>
<A NAME="fsvic"></A><h4>External Attributes Fetch</h4>
<p>This option enables callbacks for plug-ins to retrieve external attributes (any
external application-specific attribute). External attributes are not cached in the
Access Manager SDK, so this attribute allows you enable attribute retrieval per realm
level. By default, this option is not enabled</p>
<A NAME="fsvib"></A><h4>Invalid User ID Characters</h4>
<p>This attribute defines a list of characters that are not allowed in a user's
name. Each character must be separated by the | character. For example: </p>
<p><tt>*|(|)|&amp;|!</tt></p>
<A NAME="fsvie"></A><h4>UserID and Password Validation Plug-in Class</h4>
<p>This class provides a userID and password validation plug-in mechanism. The
methods of this class need to be overridden by the implementation plug-in modules
that validate the userID and/or password for the user. The implementation plug-in
modules will be invoked whenever a userID or password value is being added or modified
using the Access Manager console, the <tt>amadmin</tt> command line interface,
or using the SDK. </p>
<p>The plug-ins that extend this class can be configured per realm. If a plug-in
is not configured for an realm, then the plug-in configured at the global level will
be used. </p>
<p>If the validation of the plug-in fails, the plug-in module can throw an exception
to notify the application to indicate the error in the userID or password supplied
by the user.</p>
