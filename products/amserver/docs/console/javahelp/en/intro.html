<p>Sun Java System Access Manager prevents unauthorized access to web service applications
and web content. Access Manager integrates authentication and authorization services,
policy agents, and identity federation to provide a comprehensive solution for protecting
your network resources. </p>
<p>Many enterprises grant access to information on a per-application basis. For
example, an employee might have to set up a user name and password to access the company's
health benefits administration website. The same employee must use a different user
name and password to access the Accounting Department online forms. Within the same
enterprise, a customer sets up a user name and password to access the public branch
of the company website. For each website or service, an administrator must convert
the enterprise user's input into a data format that the service can recognize. Each
service added to the enterprise must be provisioned and maintained separately. </p>
<p>Access Manager reduces the administrative costs and eliminates the redundant
user information associated with per-application solutions. Access Manager enables
an administrator to assign specific rules or policies governing which information
or services each user can access. Policy agents are deployed on application or web
servers to process HTTP requests and to enforce active policies.  Together, a user's
information and associated access policies comprise the user's enterprise identity.
Access Manager makes it possible for a user to access many resources in the enterprise
with just one identity. </p>
