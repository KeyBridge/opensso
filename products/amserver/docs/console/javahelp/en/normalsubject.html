<A NAME="normalsubject"></A><h3>Subjects</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-23"></A><A NAME="indexterm-24"></A>A <i>subject</i> defines the user or collection of users
(for instance, a group or those who possess a specific role) that the policy affects.
The general rule for subjects is that the policy would apply only if the user is a
member of at least one subject in the policy. The default subjects are:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="5"><tr valign="top"><td>Access Manager Identity Subject</td><td><p>This subject implies that the identities you create and manage under
the Realms Subject tab can be added as a member of the subject.</p>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Access Manger Roles</td><td><p>This subject type implies that any member of an Access Manager role
is a member of this subject. An Access Manager role is created using Access Manager.
These roles have object classes mandated by Access Manager. Access Manager roles can
only be accessed through the hosting Access Manager Policy Service.</p>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Authenticated Users</td><td><p>This subject type implies that any user with a valid SSOToken is a
member of this subject.</p>
<p>All authenticated users would be member of this Subject, even if they have authenticated
to an organization that is different from the organization in which the policy is
defined. This is useful if the resource owner would like to give access to resources
that is managed for users from other organizations. If you want to restrict access
to resources being protected to members of a specific organization, please use the
Organization subject.</p>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>LDAP Groups</td><td><p> This subject type implies that any member of an LDAP group is member
of this subject.</p>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>LDAP Roles</td><td><p>This subject type implies that any member of an LDAP role is a member
of this subject. An LDAP Role is any role definition that uses the Directory Server
role capability. These roles have object classes mandated by Directory Server role
definition. The LDAP Role Search filter can be modified in the Policy Configuration
Service to narrow the scope and improve performance.</p>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>LDAP Users</td><td><p> This subject type implies that any LDAP user is a member of this
subject.</p>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Organization</td><td><p> This subject type implies that any member of an organization is a
member of this subject</p>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Web Services Clients</td><td><p>his subject type implies that a web service client (WSC) identified
by the SSOToken is a member of this subject, if the DN of any principal contained
in the SSOToken matches any selected value of this subject. Valid values are the DNs
of trusted certificates in the local JKS keystore, which correspond to the certificates
of trusted WSCs. This subject has dependency on the Liberty Web Services Framework
and should be used only by Liberty Service Providers to authorize WSCs.</p>
<p>Make sure that you have created the keystore before you add this Subject to
a policy. Information on setting up the keystore can be found in the following location:</p>
