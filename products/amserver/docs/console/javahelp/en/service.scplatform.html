<a name="service.scplatform"></a><h4>Platform</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-211"></a>The Platform service is where additional servers can be added to the Federated
Access Manager configuration as well as other options applied at the top level
of the Federated Access Manager application. The Platform service attributes are global attributes.
The attributes are:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#fxcsy">Site Name</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxcqf">Instance Name</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxcgy">Platform Locale</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxcpo">Cookie Domains</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxcsh">Login Service URL</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxcrt">Logout Service URL</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxcmi">Available Locales</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxctg">Client Character Sets</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="fxcsy"></a><h5>Site Name</h5>
<p>The naming service reads this attribute at initialization time. This list uniquely identifies
the FQDN with the port number of the load balancer or SRA for
load balancing on the back-end Federated Access Manager servers. If the host specified
in a request for a service URL is not in this list, the
naming service will reject the request. Only the naming service protocol should be
used in this attribute. See <b>Broken Link (Target ID: SERVICE.SCPLATFORMSITELISTADD)</b>.</p>

<a name="fxcqf"></a><h5>Instance Name</h5>
<p>The naming service reads this attribute at initialization time. This list contains the
Federated Access Manager session servers in a single Federated Access Manager configuration. For
example, if two Federated Access Managers are installed and should work as one,
they must both be included in this list. If the host specified in
a request for a service URL is not in this list, the naming
service will reject the request. Only the naming service protocol should be used
in this attribute. See <b>Broken Link (Target ID: SERVICE.SCPLATFORMSERVERLISTADD)</b>.</p>

<a name="fxcgy"></a><h5>Platform Locale</h5>
<p>The platform locale value is the default language subtype that Federated Access Manager
was installed with. The authentication, logging and administration services are administered in the
language of this value. The default is en_US. See <a href="supportedlang.html">Supported Language Locales</a>for a listing of
supported language subtypes.</p>

<a name="fxcpo"></a><h5>Cookie Domains</h5>
<p>The list of domains that will be returned in the cookie header when
setting a cookie to the user's browser during authentication. If empty, no cookie
domain will be set. In other words, the Federated Access Manager session cookie
will only be forwarded to the Federated Access Manager itself and to no
other servers in the domain.</p><p>If SSO is required with other servers in the domain, this attribute must
be set with the cookie domain. If you had two interfaces in
different domains on one Federated Access Manager then you would need to set both
cookie domains in this attribute. If a load balancer is used, the cookie
domain must be that of the load balancer's domain, not the servers behind
the load balancer. The default value for this field is the domain of
the installed Federated Access Manager.</p>

<a name="fxcsh"></a><h5>Login Service URL</h5>
<p>This field specifies the URL of the login page. The default value for
this attribute is <tt>/Service_DEPLOY_URI/UI/Login</tt>.</p>

<a name="fxcrt"></a><h5>Logout Service URL</h5>
<p>This field specifies the URL of the logout page. The default value for
this attribute is <tt>/Service_DEPLOY_URI/UI/Logout</tt>.</p>

<a name="fxcmi"></a><h5>Available Locales</h5>
<p>This attribute stores all available locales configured for the platform. Consider an application
that lets the user choose the user's locale. This application would get this
attribute from the platform profile and present the list of locales to the
user. The user would choose a locale and the application would set this
in the user entry  <i>preferredLocale</i>.</p>

<a name="fxctg"></a><h5>Client Character Sets</h5>
<p>This attribute specifies the character set for different clients at the platform level.
It contains a list of client types and the corresponding character sets. See<a href="service.scplatformclientcharsetsadd.html">To Create a New Character Set</a>
for more information.</p>
