%% 1. Build requirements

The OpenSSO workspace uses Apache Ant as the build tool. The build scripts
in this workspace use features not present in releases of Ant prior to 1.6.
Thus, in order to build this workspace you must have Ant version 1.6 or above
installed and available in your system path.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 5.0 with the source
and target levels set to "1.4". In order to allow this, you must ensure that
JDK 5.0 is present in your system path and the JAVA_HOME environment variable
is setup correctly pointing to its location.

%% 2. Library dependencies

The OpenSSO sources depend on the following libraries:

   - J2EE SDK version 1.3.1: j2ee.jar
   - Java Mail version 1.2 : mail.jar
   - JWSDP version 1.6: jaxb-api.jar, jaxrpc-api.jar
   - Mozilla LDAP JDK version 4.17: ldapjdk.jar
   - SleepyCat Berkeley DB version 4.2.52: db.jar

These libraries are not included as a part of the workspace and must be
obtained directly. Some libraries such as LDAP JDK and SleepyCat Berkeley DB 
are available in source distribution form and must be built locally before
they can be used. Refer to library vendor documentation for complete 
details of how these libraries can be built.

Once you have these libraries available, they should be placed under the
extlib directory in order that the build can reference them for compilation
purposes. 

%% 3. Building the workspace

The workspace build system offers many build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the
workspace.
