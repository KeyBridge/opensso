    <section title="Description">
    <paragraph>
    Here are a set of samples for OpenSSO. There are two parts to this set of
    samples. It is the commandline and the Web ARchive (WAR) parts. The 
    commandline samples can be executed from this directory by executing
    the bat/script files. Please remember that they have to the executed
    from this base directory otherwise the Java classpath will be incorrect.
    You have to do the following to setup the samples.
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
    <orderedlist nocontext="no">
    <item>on the shell prompt,<br />
        <code>scripts/setup.sh</code> (have to <code>chmod</code> to make it
        executable) for Unix and Linux; or<br />
        <code>scripts/setup.bat</code> for Windows.<br />
    This setup class will prompt for some server information; create the 
    <code>AMConfig.properties</code> file under <code>war/WEB-INF/classes</code>
    and <code>classes</code> directories.
    </item>
    <item>type <code>ant war</code> to create the WAR file and deploy it. (Visit
    the deployed web application; and you will receive instructions on how to
    run the samples on the web.)
    </item>
    </orderedlist></paragraph>
    <paragraph>
    Note: Ant (<code>http://ant.apache.org/</code>) version 1.6 or higher is
    needed for the sample.
    <br />
    Source code is found under source sub directory. Followings are the
    standalone Java samples.

        <code>scripts/CommandLineSSO.bat</code> for Windows.
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
    2. SSOTokenSample.java
    This takes a Single Sign-On token ID and displays the token attributes. It
    also demonstrates how to set and get token Property.
    To execute this samples, type <br />
        <code>scripts/SSOTokenSample.sh</code> for Unix and Linux; or<br />
        <code>scripts/SSOTokenSample.bat</code> for Windows.
    You can get a Single Sign-On token ID by authenticating to the server; and
    then visit the client SDK sample web application's Single Sign On Token
    Verification Servlet.
