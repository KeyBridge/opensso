%% 1. Build requirements

The OpenSSO workspace uses Apache Ant as the build tool. The build scripts
in this workspace use features not present in releases of Ant prior to 1.6.
Thus, in order to build this workspace you must have Ant version 1.6.5 or above
installed and available in your system path.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 5.0 with the source
and target levels set to "1.5". In order to allow this, you must ensure that
JDK 5.0 is present in your system path and the JAVA_HOME environment variable
is setup correctly pointing to its location.

%% 2. Library dependencies

The OpenSSO sources depend upon j2ee.jar that are not included as a part of
the workspace and must be obtained directly from the library vendor.
This jar needs to be placed under the extlib directory of the workspace.
Any library placed in this directory is automatically included in the classpath
during the compilation phase of the build process.

The j2ee.jar library can be obtained from J2EE SDK version 1.5.
Follow these steps to obtain the J2EE SDK:

2.1.1 Open the web page: http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/index.jsp
2.1.2 Depending on your choice of platform, you may choose to download any
      one of the three distribution types available.
2.1.3 Extract or extract and install the downloaded file as necessary to
      have the SDK available on your system.

Once the J2EE SDK is installed, you can get the j2ee.jar from the
lib directory of this SDK. 

%% 3. Building the workspace

The workspace build system offers a few build targets.  The default target
that is executed is the all target.
   
     - build      : compiles the sources
     - all        : builds jar file
