%% 1. Agent Installation

Please make sure that the Apache Server 2.0.55 is installed and running. Also
make sure that the Apache Agent is compiled with steps indicated in README.txt.

The installation steps are now manual but in future there will be an 
installation tool to perform the following steps.

%% 1.1 Creating the Apache Agent Installation Directory

1.1.1 Create the following Apache Agent install directory (/opt/apache-agent)
1.1.2 cp <apache-agent-src-dir>/products/dsame/webagents/agents/source/apache/libamapc2.so /opt/apache-agent
1.1.3 cp <apache-agent-src-dir>/products/dsame/webagents/extlib/Linux/libxml2/lib/libxml2.so.2 /opt/apache-agent
1.1.4 cp <apache-agent-src-dir>/products/dsame/webagents/conf/AMAgent.properties /opt/apache-agent
1.1.5 cp <apache-agent-src-dir>/products/dsame/webagents/agents/source/apache/dsame.conf /opt/apache-agent
1.1.6 Open /opt/apache-agent/dsame.conf
1.1.7 Replace MODULE with /opt/apache-agent
1.1.8 Replace EAPI with 2
1.1.9 Replace DSAMECONFIG with /opt/apache-agent/AMAgent.properties
1.1.10 Save the file

%% 1.2 Tag Swapping in AMAgent.properties file

The file AMAgent.properties which is used by the Apache Agent has few tags 
which needs to be manually swapped with the information of where the 
Access Manager (AM) is running and where the Apache Server is running.

1.2.1 Open /opt/apache-agent/AMAgent.properties
1.2.2 Please perform the below tag swapping

PRIMARY_NAMING_URL = <AM Protocol>://<Fully Qualified AM Hostname>:<AM Port number>/amserver/namingservice 
If Failover server is there, populate the below tag with Failover server 
information else leave it blank (remove the tag).
FAILOVER_NAMING_URL = <AM Protocol>://<Fully Qualified AM Hostname>:<AM Port number>/amserver/namingservice 

PRIMARY_LOGIN_URL = <AM Protocol>://<Fully Qualified AM Hostname>:<AM Port number>/amserver/UI/Login
If Failover server is there, populate the below tag with Failover server 
information else leave it blank (remove the tag).
FAILOVER_LOGIN_URL = <AM Protocol>://<Fully Qualified AM Hostname>:<AM Port number>/amserver/namingservice 
LOG_ROTATION = false
AGENT_HOST = <Enter the hostname of where agent is running>
AGENT_PORT = <Enter the port number where agent protected apache server is 
running>
USER_NAME = UrlAccessAgent
To populate the value for SHARED_SECRET, please perform the below steps:
  a) <apache-agent-src-dir>/products/dsame/webagents/am/source/crypt_util <amldapuser password>
  b) Get the encrypted value and assign it to SHARED_SECRET
SERVER_DIR = If you are running SSL, this will be the location where the 
certificates are kept else leave it blank (remove the tag).
AGENT_CERT_PREFIX = If you are running SSL, this will be the certificate data
base prefix else leave it blank (remove the tag).
NOTIFICATION_ENABLE = false
AGENT_URL_PREFIX = <Agent protocol>://<Fully qualified Agent Hostname>

For the below property, specify the value as shown:
com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.local.log.file = /opt/apache-agent/amAgent

%% 1.3 Updating Apache Server httpd.conf file

1.3.1 cd <apache-install-dir>/conf
1.3.2 Open httpd.conf and go to the end of the file
1.3.3 Add the below line
      include /opt/apache-agent/dsame.conf
