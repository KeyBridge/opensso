# AGENT DEBUG LOG LEVEL
#   Set the logging level for the specified logging categories.
#   The format of the values is

#      <ModuleName>[:<Level>][,<ModuleName>[:<Level>]]*
#
#   The currently used module names are: AuthService, NamingService,
#   PolicyService, SessionService, PolicyEngine, ServiceEngine,
#   Notification, PolicyAgent, RemoteLog and all.
#
#   The all module can be used to set the logging level for all currently
#   none logging modules.  This will also establish the default level for
#   all subsequently created modules.
#
#   The meaning of the 'Level' value is described below:
#
#      0       Disable logging from specified module*
#      1       Log error messages
#      2       Log warning and error messages
#      3       Log info, warning, and error messages
#      4       Log debug, info, warning, and error messages
#      5       Like level 4, but with even more debugging messages
#      128     log url access to log file on AM server.
#      256     log url access to log file on local machine.
#
#   If level is omitted, then the logging module will be created with
#   the default logging level, which is the logging level associated with
#   the 'all' module.
#
#   For level of 128 and 256, you must also specify audit.access.type property.
#
#   Even if the level is set to zero, some messages may be produced for
#   a module if they are logged with the special level value of 'always'.

# Hot-Swap Enabled: Yes

#
com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.check.enable = true

#
# FQDN DEFAULT VALUE
#   Default FQDN is the fully qualified hostname that the users should use
#   in order to access resources on this web server instance. This is a
#   required configuration value without which the Web server may not
#   startup correctly.
#
#   The primary purpose of specifying this property is to ensure that if
#   the users try to access protected resources on this web server
#   instance without specifying the FQDN in the browser URL, the Agent
#   can take corrective action and redirect the user to the URL that
#   contains the correct FQDN.
#
#   This property is set during the agent installation and need not be
#   modified unless absolutely necessary to accommodate deployment 
#   requirements. 
#
# WARNING: Invalid value for this property can result in the Web Server
# becoming unusable or the resources becoming inaccessible.
#
# See also: com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.check.enable,
#           com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.map[]

# Hot-Swap Enabled: Yes

#
# FQDN MAP
#   The FQDN Map is a simple map that enables the Agent to take corrective
#   action in the case where the users may have typed in an incorrect URL
#   such as by specifying partial hostname or using an IP address to
#   access protected resources.  It redirects the browser to the URL
#   with fully qualified domain name so that cookies related to the domain
#   are received by the agents.
#
#   The format for this property is:
#
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[invalid_hostname] = valid_hostname
#
#   This property can also be used so that the agents use the name specified
#   in this map instead of the web server's actual name. This can be
#   accomplished by doing the following.
#   Say you want your server to be addressed as xyz.hostname.com whereas the
#   actual name of the server is abc.hostname.com.  The browsers only knows
#   xyz.hostname.com and you have specified polices using xyz.hostname.com at
#   the Access Manager policy console, in this file set the mapping as
#
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid1]= xyz.hostname.com
#
#   Another example is if you have multiple virtual servers say rst.hostname.com,
#   uvw.hostname.com and xyz.hostname.com pointing to the same actual server
#   abc.hostname.com and each of the virtual servers have their own policies 
#   defined, then the fqdnMap should be defined as follows:
#
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid1] = rst.hostname.com
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid2] = uvw.hostname.com
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid3] = xyz.hostname.com
#
#   Another example including all the above:
#
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[invalid_hostname] = valid_hostname
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid1] = rst.hostname.com
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid2] = uvw.hostname.com
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid3] = xyz.hostname.com

#
#   If "Domain" is not specified, then the default agent domain is

# NOT ENFORCED URL PROPERTIES
#   - notenforced.url: The list of URLs for which no authentication is 
#       required. Wildcards can be used to define a pattern of URLs. 
#       The URLs specified may not contain any query parameters.
#   - notenforced.url.invert: Indicate whether the above list is a not 
#       enforced list or an enforced list; When the value is true, the list 
#       means enforced list, or in other words, the whole web site is 
#       open/accessible without authentication except for those URLs in the list.
#   - notenforced.url.attributes.enable: Indicates whether profile attributes need
#       to be fetched for not enforced urls also. This involve policy evaluation to
#       fetch attributes.
#   - notenforced.ip: Not enforced client IP address list is a list of 
#       client IP addresses. No authentication and authorization are required

# FETCH POLICY DECISIONS FROM ROOT RESOURCE
#   By default, when a policy decision for a resource is needed,

#   For example, if the resource is http://host/a/b/c, the the root of the 
#   resource is http://host/. This is because more resources from the 
#   same path are likely to be accessed subsequently. 
#   However this may take a long time the first time if there 
#   are many many policies defined under the root resource.
#   To have agent get and cache the policy decision for the resource only,

# Hot-Swap Enabled: Yes

#
# Hot-Swap Enabled: Yes
#
com.sun.identity.agents.config.encode.url.special.chars.enable = false

#
# IGNORE URL PATH
#   When the not enforced list or policy has a wildcard '*' character, agent 
#   strips the path info from the request URI and uses the resulting request 
#   URI to check against the not enforced list or policy instead of the entire 
#   request URI, in order to prevent someone from getting access to any URI by 
#   simply appending the matching pattern in the policy or not enforced list. 
#   For example, if the not enforced list has the value http://host/*.gif,
#   stripping the path info from the request URI will prevent someone from 
#   getting access to http://host/index.html by using the URL http://host/index.html?hack.gif.
#   However when a web server (for exmample apache) is configured to be a reverse
#   proxy server for a J2EE application server, path info is interpreted in a different 
#   manner since it maps to a resource on the proxy instead of the app server.  
#   This prevents the not enforced list or policy from being applied to part of 
#   the URI below the app serverpath if there is a wildcard character. For example, 
#   if the not enforced list has value  http://host/webapp/servcontext/* and the 
#   request URL is http://host/webapp/servcontext/example.jsp the path info 
#   is /servcontext/example.jsp and the resulting request URL with path info stripped
#   is http://host/webapp, which will not match the not enforced list. By setting the 
#   following property to true, the path info will not be stripped from the request URL 
#   even if there is a wild character in the not enforced list or policy. 
#   Be aware though that if this is set to true there should be nothing following the
#   wildcard character '*' in the not enforced list or policy, or the 
#   security loophole described above may occur.

#   Override the notification url in the same way as other request urls.
