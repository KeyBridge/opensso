# Set the logging level for the specified logging categories.
# The format of the values is
#
#	<ModuleName>[:<Level>][,<ModuleName>[:<Level>]]*
#
# The currently used module names are: AuthService, NamingService,
# PolicyService, SessionService, PolicyEngine, ServiceEngine,
# Notification, PolicyAgent, RemoteLog and all.
#
# The all module can be used to set the logging level for all currently
# none logging modules.  This will also establish the default level for
# all subsequently created modules.
#
# The meaning of the 'Level' value is described below:
#
#	0	Disable logging from specified module*
#	1	Log error messages
#	2	Log warning and error messages
#	3	Log info, warning, and error messages
#	4	Log debug, info, warning, and error messages
#	5	Like level 4, but with even more debugging messages
# 128	log url access to log file on AM server. 
# 256	log url access to log file on local machine. 
#
# If level is omitted, then the logging module will be created with
# the default logging level, which is the logging level associated with
# the 'all' module.
#
# for level of 128 and 256, you must also specify a logAccessType.

# *Even if the level is set to zero, some messages may be produced for
# a module if they are logged with the special level value of 'always'.
