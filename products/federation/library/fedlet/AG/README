%% 2. How to use AG.war for demo 
     
Before deploying the Assertion generator war file, the fedlet has to be configured i.e. there should a fedlet directory that should present in the home directory with all the IDP and SP meta data. If IDP is not using the default private key or the IDP metadata is unknown then only add SP metadata and FederationConfig.properties files in the fedlet directory.Deploy the AG war in the same web container. If the IDP metadata is not present it will prompt if you would to use the IDP data as provided by the AG. 
AG index page has relaystate and attribute input fields for the user to enter.  To add the attributes the user first need to remove the null value. Selecting the null value from the first column and click on the remove button will remove the value. Now to add an attribute enter the name and value of the attribute in the respective field and click enter. Once all the attribute have been entered, select all the values under the Name column and similarly select all the values under the Value column.
Now press submit, if the fedlet is configured correctly the single sign on will be successful.
