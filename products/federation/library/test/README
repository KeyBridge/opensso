Open Federation - Library Unit test.

Steps:
 1. Setup the test
     - unzip openfm/built/test/dist/openfed-library-test.zip to a directory
 2. Run the test
     - type "ant" to run all test suites; or to selectively run individually
       test suite, invoke the specific target in the ant build XML.

Specific steps to run SAML 1.x autotest: 
 1.Setup keystore 
   Run "keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa -alias test -dname "cn=sun-unix,ou=SUN Java System Access Manager,o=Sun, c=US" -keypass 11111111 -keystore keystore.jks -storepass 11111111"
 2.Create a new file named .storepass and put key store password to this file.
   For this particular example, we put "11111111" to file .storepass.
 3.Create a new file named .keypass and put key password to this file.    
   For this particular example, we put "11111111" to file .keypass. 
 4.Configure the following attributes in 
   <install dir>/classes/FederationConfig.properties,
   make sure they point to the correct location of your keystore, keypass
   file, key store password file, and correct default cert alias. 
   For example: 
   com.sun.identity.saml.xmlsig.keystore=/opensso/keystore.jks
   com.sun.identity.saml.xmlsig.storepass=/opensso/.storepass
   com.sun.identity.saml.xmlsig.keypass=/opensso/.keypass
   com.sun.identity.saml.xmlsig.certalias=test   
 5.Change com.sun.identity.common.serverMode=false in 
    <install dir>/classes/FederationConfig.properties 
 6.Run the test
     - type "ant" to run all test suites;
