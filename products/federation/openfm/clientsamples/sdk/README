This README file provides brief instructions on running Federated Access Manager
client sdk samples  that would run in a stand alone JVM, outside of any
container.

1. Unzip the fam-client.zip. You would find a directory clientsamples/sdk. This
directory has all that is required to try out Federated Access Manager client sdk samples.
The directory is laid out as below.

sdk
    source (contains source files that require compilation)

    scripts (contains scripts to compile and run samples)

    resources (contains resources required to run the samples)

    lib (contains jar files required to use the Federated Access Manager clientsdk)

    classes (contains the classes that would result from compiling the source files)

2. to compile the samples, run scripts/compile-samples.sh

3. to run the sample, run scripts/run-<samplename>.sh
Sample runtime may require, additional property files to be correctly set up
under resoruces directory. This would be specifically mentioned in the
comments included in corresponding scripts/run-<samplename>.sh
