<h1><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Federated Access Manager
Integration with Oracle Access Manager</span></small><br>
</h1>
===============================================================================<br>
<br>
This README explains the Federation Access Manager (FAM) SSO
Integration with Oracle Access Manager previously known as Oblix. The
README must
be read in the context of Federated Access Manager Integration Document
where the use cases, possible integrations and configurations are
described in detail.<br>
<br>
This README explains the custom codes for e.g. Authentication
Modules,&nbsp; compilation instructions and the configuration of the
auth modules for Federated Access Manager context. The FAM custom
authentication enables the SSO integration between legacy Oblix&nbsp;
Access Server and Federation Access Manager especially when the
deployment contains Oblix for protecting existing applications.<br>
<br>
1. Pre-requisites :<br>
==========<br>
<br>

the&nbsp; integration souce code, configuration files and ofcourse this
README file along with regular opensso.war<br>
2. Oracle Access Manager 10g (10.1.4.0.1)&nbsp;&nbsp; - The Oracle
Access Manager must be installed and configured. For more details,
check the<br>
&nbsp; Oracle Access Manager Documenation. You can download from Oracle
Web site for evaluation.<br>
3. Oracle Access Manager SDK
10g(10.1.4.0.1) - The Oracle Access Manager SDK
must be installed and configured. The SDK is required to compile and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build Federated Access Manager Authentication
Modules for Oracle Access Manager. <br>

5. Federation Access Manager C-SDK 2.2<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Brief Description of Contents:<br>
======================<br>
<br>
The opensso/integrations directory contains source and configurations
to compile and build the custom authentication modules and other
plugins.&nbsp; Check the FAM integration document for your use case and
configure accordingly. This document provides instructions on how to
configure authentication modules<br>
<br>
The opensso.zip contains "opensso/integrations/oracle" directory
where the source code and configurations are in place..<br>
<br>
Readme.html&nbsp; - This file.<br>
<br>
build.xml - This file is a build script for building <br>
<br>
config - This directory contains auth module configuration files.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OblixAuthService.xml&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is oblix auth
module configuration file that must be imported into FAM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OblixAuthModule.xml&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; This file is used for auth
module
call backs and for Siteminder auth module they are empty. However, the
file must be used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OblixAuth.properties&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; This file is a
properties file that stores i18n keys for siteminder authentication
module configuration lables.<br>
<br>
lib - This directory is by default empty . However, this lib directory
must contain all the necessary libraries to compile the source
libraries. They are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jobaccess.jar (Oracle
Access Manager SDK jar file)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; openfedlib.jar,
opensso.jar, opensso-sharedlib.jar (OpenSSO jar files)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; servlet .jar file (If
it's Glassfish, it is javaee.jar)<br>
<br>
source - This directory contains all the source files<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
com/sun/identity/authentication/oblix/OAMAuthModule.java <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
com/sun/identity/authentication/siteminder/OAMPrincipal.java<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above java source
files are the custom authentication module classes that would be
plugged into Federated Access Manager for generating FAM Session by<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; using Oblix session.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
com/sun/identity/saml2/plugins/OAMAdapter.java&nbsp; - This class is a
SAML2 Plugin Adapter for SAML service providers to do the remote
authentication to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Oracle Access Manager using FAM
Session.
Essentially these java files are used for usecase2 in FAM integration
document.<br>
<br>
oamauth- This directory contains source files for&nbsp; Oblix Auth
Scheme for Federation Access Manager. This is a C-based auth module and
leverages Access Manager C-SDK for validation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oam/solaris/authn_api.c-&nbsp; This file
implements Oblix custom authentication for FAM.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oam/solaris/include/*.h -&nbsp; All the
header files that are required to compile auth scheme.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oam/solaris/AMAgent.properties&nbsp; -
Sample FAM Agent Configuration file. This is required for the auth
scheme to validate FAM session.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
3: How to build:<br>
===========<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; Make sure all the siteminder libraries and FAM libraries
present in lib directory as mentioned above.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp; Use&nbsp; "ant" script to build the source files. A compatible
ant must be installed and configured in the PATH.<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp; cd $openssozipdir/integrations/oracle and type ant. This
should build all the source files and generates fam_sm_integration.jar
under<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
$openssozipdir/integrations/oracle/dist directory. <br>
<br>
For building oblix authentication scheme, you must customize the
makefile. Also since this is C-based auth module, it is OS dependent.<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; The auth scheme files are located under
$openssozipdir/integrations/oracle/oamauth/solaris<br>
<br>
2. Download and configure FAM C-SDK 2.2 version. The authn_api.c
contains a reference to AMAgent.propeties file , so modify accordingly.<br>
<br>
3. Customize makefile for your environment for e.g. gcc compile
location. Also edit the LDFLAGS to point to your FAM C-SDK lib
directory.<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp; make command should result in authn_api.so file.<br>
<br>
4. OpenSSO Installation and Configuration with Oracle AuthModule:<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Create a temporary directory&nbsp; for e.g. /export/tmp and unwar
the opensso.war using jar -xvf opensso.war. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From now on, /export/tmp is called as a war staging
area and is represented with a marco $WAR_DIR <br>
<br>
2. Copy
$openssozipdir/integrations/oracle/dist/fam_oam_integration.jar to
$WAR_DIR/WEB-INF/lib<br>
<br>
3. Copy $openssozipdir/integrations/oracle/config/OblixAuth.properties
to $WAR_DIR/WEB-INF/classes <br>
<br>
4. Copy $openssozipdir/integrations/oracle/config/OAMAuthModule.xml
to $WAR_DIR/config/auth/default and also to the directory<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
$WAR_DIR/config/auth/default_en<br>
<br>
5. Re-war opensso.war using jar cvf opensso.war from $WAR_DIR<br>
<br>
6. Deploy opensso.war onto FAM web container. The deployment is self
explanatory. Please check the web container documentation for war<br>
deployment.<br>
<br>
7. Access the deployed opensso directory <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/opensso<br>
<br>
8. Accessing deployed application redirects to opensso configurator.
Choose custom configuration. By default FAM uses embedded directory<br>
server for configuration, however, you could choose to use existing or
a new directory server instance for configuration. <br>
<br>
Note: The federation access manager can be configured to use various
user repository for validating the user existance, however, you could
also choose to ignore profile. <br>
<br>
9. After successful configuration, the configuration redirects to a
user login and verify your administrator credentials. <br>
<br>
5. Oblix Auth module configuration:<br>
========================<br>
<br>
Now we have to load the Oblix authentication module service
into&nbsp; Open SSO and configure for the SSO integration. The auth
module service<br>
is loaded from a FAM command line utility called as "famadm". For FAM,
the famadm utitily is exposed in both console mode and browser based<br>
interfaces. Here we will use use browser based famadm for FAM
configuration changes.<br>
<br>
1. Login into FAM using amadmin<br>
<br>
2. Now access the following URL<br>
http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/opensso/famadm.jsp<br>
<br>
3. Choose create-service option. <br>
<br>
4. Copy and paste the xml file from
$openssozipdir/integrations/oracle/config/OblixAuthService.xml and
Submit<br>
This will load the auth module service into FAM configuration.<br>
<br>
5. Register the auth module into the authentication core framework. <br>
<br>
http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/opensso/famadm.jsp<br>
Choose register-auth-module option.<br>
Enter "com.sun.identity.authentication.siteminder.OAMAuthModule" as the
auth module class name.<br>
<br>
6. Now verify that the auth module is registered to the default realm.
http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/opensso, click on default realm, and
click on<br>
"authentication" tab, create new AuthModule as "OblixAuth" and choose
OblixAuthModule<br>
<br>
7. Click on OblixAuth auth module<br>
<br>
8. Most of the Oblix Auth params are self explanatory. This requires
Oblix SDK directory and make sure that&nbsp; ObAccessClient.xml
(located under $OAMSDK/<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; oblix/lib) is configured properly. For details on Oracle
Access Manager SDK, check the Oracle Documentation<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Oblix Auth Module Testing:<br>
====================<br>
<br>
The testing of oblix auth module assumes that Oracle Access Manager SDK
is already
installed and configured. <br>
<br>
1. Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for loading Oblix&nbsp; SDK libraries.They
are located under $OAM_SDK_INSTALL/oblix/lib<br>
<br>
2. Restart the OpenSSO web container with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set and make
sure that container is loaded with these Oblix&nbsp; SDK shared libs.<br>
<br>
3. Now access the siteminder protected application and login with
siteminder configured user to establish ObSession. The configuration<br>
of&nbsp; oblix policy and authentication schemes are outside scope of
this documentation and please check Oracle Access Manager documentation
for more <br>
information.&nbsp; Also, check the FAM integration guide for sample
configuration.<br>
<br>
4. After successful authentication at Oracle Access Manager, access the
FAM
auth module url as follows:<br>
<br>
http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/opensso/UI/Login?module=OblixAuth<br>
<br>
This should provide a valid FAM session.<br>
<br>
Note: Assumption here is that Oblix and FAM are in the same
physical domain. <br>
<br>
By default FAM authentication framework looks for user profile
existance in it's known data repositories. However, you could use
ignoreProfile<br>
option if your integration does not require a user to be searched from
siteminder's user repository. Check the FAM documentation for more info<br>
about ignoreProfile option.<br>
<br>
7. Installation of&nbsp; Oblix AuthScheme into Oracle Access Manager:<br>
============================================<br>
<br>
This section is for a use case where the Oblix session needs to be
generated upon validating FAM session.&nbsp; Check the integration
document for<br>
use case descriptions. The Oblix Auth Schemes are exposed as C Auth
modules and this auth scheme uses FAM C-SDK 2.2 version to validate<br>
FAM Session.<br>
<br>
The FAM Auth Scheme in Oblix uses a configuration FAM client side
configuration in AMAgent.properties and this must need to be customized<br>
before configuring the auth module. The build instructions specify the
location of this file.<br>
<br>
The compiled authn_api.so and other C-SDK libraries must need to be
copied to $OAM_INSTALL_DIR/access/oblix/lib before configuring the<br>
&nbsp;Auth Scheme. The integration guide shows a sample screen shot how
to configure the Oracle Auth Scheme.<br>
