<p>
The Open Web SSO project provides core identity services to facilitate the implementation of transparent Single Sign-On as an infrastructure security component. Targeted 

towards the web tier, this 

project provides the foundation for achieving seamless integration of diverse web applications that typically operate against a disparate set of identity repositories and 

are hosted on a variety of 

platforms such as web and application servers. This project is based on the code base of Sun Java(tm) System Access Manager product, a core identity infrastructure product 

offered by Sun 

Microsystems.
</p>
<p>
The intended audience for this project are intermediate to advanced skill level developers and IT managers who want to use this project to achieve intranet and/or extranet 

Single Sign-On for their 

hosted web applications.
</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>
The goal of Open Web SSO project is to provide an extensible implementation of identity services infrastructure that will facilitate Single Sign-On for web applications 

hosted on web and 

application servers. This implementation will offer the following core identity services:
<ul>
<li>Authentication
<li>Session 
<li>Logging
</ul>
Apart from the above mentioned services, the Open Web SSO project will also provide a platform for creating and integrating custom services where necessary.
