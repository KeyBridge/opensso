<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="what_is"></a> What is OpenSSO?</b></b></p>


<p>The Open Web Single Sign-On Project, also referred to as OpenSSO, is an open development effort based on the source code for <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml">Sun Java<sup>TM</sup> System Access Manager</a>, a core identity infrastructure product offered by Sun Microsystems, Inc. The goal of OpenSSO is to provide an extensible foundation for an identity services infrastructure that will facilitate single sign-on (SSO) for web applications hosted on web and application servers in the public domain.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="why"></a> Why would Sun open source SSO?</b></b></p>

<p>Sun's goal is to improve developer access to this technology so that it can become a ubiquitous part of web security infrastructure. It is a given that companies are going to secure their internal web infrastructure using SSO technology, and the OpenSSO project gives developers the freedom to do that without adding software license costs to their budgets. The official Sun Microsystems answer to this FAQ can be found on the Sun web site at <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity/opensso/faq.xml">http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity/opensso/faq.xml</a>.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="benefits"></a> What are the benefits of open-sourcing software?</b></b></p>

<p><ul>
<li>Allows developers to cooperate freely across time and distance with a minimum of legal restrictions.</li>
<li>Increases code quality and security.</li>
<li>Reduces deployment costs.</li>
<li>Increases the capacity for customization.</li>
<li>Encourages reusable software.</li>
<li>Enables a community where skill and merit matter.</li>
</ul></p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="openssobenefits"></a> What are the benefits of OpenSSO?</b></b></p>

<p>The modules available in OpenSSO make up a common identity service, allowing for user authentication and single sign-on within a domain. Sun is providing this identity service to developers so they can incorporate it into each web or J2EE-based application and service they provide to internal employees and contractors. The availability of open source code that provides identity-based authentication and single sign-on capabilities will lead to broad adoption of the technology in the Java community.
</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="comprises"></a> What comprises OpenSSO?</b></b></p>

<p>Sun Microsystems will provide the source for the following modules contained in Sun Java System Access Manager to the Java developer community on a free right to use basis:

<ul>
<li>Session Management</li>
<li>Policy</li>
<li>Console</li>
<li>Administration tools</li>
<li>Federation</li>
<li>Policy agents</li>
</ul></p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="objectives"></a> What are the objectives of the OpenSSO project?</b></b></p>

<p><ul>
<li>To provide open access to an identity infrastructure source code.</li>
<li>To enable innovation to build the next generation of open network identity services.</li>
<li>To establish open XML-based file formats and language-independent component applicatin programming interfaces (API).</li>
</ul></p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="large"></a> How large is the OpenSSO community?</b></b></p>

<p>The OpenSSO project, for all intents and purposes, went live in July, 2006 so the development community is small. The expectation is that developers working on the open source code will greatly increase as news of the project spreads.

</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="url"></a> What is the URL for the OpenSSO project?</b></b></p>

<p>The OpenSSO project is hosted at <a href="http://opensso.dev.java.net">http://opensso.dev.java.net</a>.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="available"></a> What is available on the OpenSSO project site?</b></b></p>

<p>The OpenSSO project site contains the source code, nightly builds, the governance, documentation, forums, mailing lists, and links to relevant information. In addition, it contains instructions on how to become involved in this project.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="license"></a> What license is used for the OpenSSO code base?</b></b></p>

<p>The OpenSSO code will be released under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL). Information about this license can be found at <a href="http://www.sun.com/cddl/">http://www.sun.com/cddl/</a> and <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.php</a>.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="cost"></a> Is there any cost for using the OpenSSO source code?</b></b></p>

<p>No. The OpenSSO source code is free to use, free to modify and free to redistribute.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="register"></a> Do I need to register to use the OpenSSO source code I downloaded from the site?</b></b></p>

<p>You do not need to register as a user on the java.net site in order to download the source code for OpenSSO. Nor is there a need to register specifically as a member of the OpenSSO project.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="amversion"></a> What version of Sun Java System Access Manager has been open sourced?</b></b></p>

<p>Open sourced components are snapshots of the latest version of Access Manager under development, roughly corresponding to version 7.1. At this time, there are no plans to open source the code for previous versions of Access Manager.
</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="amname"></a> If I build the code for Access Manager, can I call it Access Manager?</b></b></p>

<p>No. You can not call what you build, or any modifications thereof, Access Manager. You can call it anything else, however, that is not already trademarked.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="participate"></a> How do I participate in the OpenSSO project?</b></b></p>
