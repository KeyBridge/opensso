<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="browse"></a> How do I browse the source code?</b></b></p>

<p>You can browse the source code without a java.net account by going to the <a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/source/browse/opensso/">Source - CVS page</a>.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="download"></a> How do I download the OpenSSO source code?</b></b></p>


<p>You can check out the source code for testing using a CVS client. You need not be a registered user. Instructions on how to do this can be found at <a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectSource">https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectSource</a>.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="allowed"></a> What am I allowed to do with the OpenSSO source code?</b></b></p>


<p>You can freely view, modify, build, use, and redistribute the OpenSSO source code. Each of the binary downloads have their own licenses with different rights and restrictions. Please refer to the <a href="">Licensing page</a> for information about the license terms associated with the source code and binaries.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="information"></a> Where do I find information about setting up the environment, getting the right tools, and actually building the source?</b></b></p>


<p>Using the <a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/source/browse/opensso/">Source - CVS</a> link, click into the <code>products/amserver</code> directory. The README in this directory contains information on requirements and dependencies. This information is reproduced in the <a href="faqbuild.html">FAQ Build Requirements and Dependencies</a>. Build instructions are available in PDF <a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/use/build/openssoSingleWAR.pdf">here</a>.       

</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="built"></a> Now that I've built the code, what do I do?</b></b></p>


<p>You can start by joining communities of interest. This will give you a sense of what work is already being done and how you can best contribute. For example, you can:

<ul>
<li>Participate in communities and discussions.</li>
<li>Find and report bugs.</li>
<li>Contribute documentation or source code.</li>
<li>Give feedback on how to make the project more successful.</li>
</ul>

To particpate in the OpenSSO project, you must register. See the Governance and the Register link in the navigation bar for more details. </p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="participate"></a> How do I participate in the communities?</b></b></p>

<p>Communities are the primary way to focus information and discussions on particular features. The OpenSSO navigation bar has links to discussion forums you can read and email aliases you can join.
</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="bug"></a> How do I report a bug?</b></b></p>


<p>See the <a href="faqbugs.html">Reporting Bugs and Security Bugs FAQ</a> for information.

</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="changes"></a> How do I make changes to files in the OpenSSO source?</b></b></p>

<p>A contributor may resolve an issue by applying new code to files in the source tree. 

<p>This is the process for making changes to files in the OpenSSO source:
<ol>
<li>Check out the latest copy of the source files.</li>
<li>Make modifications to the appropriate files to incorporate your changes or additions.</li>
<li>Write comments to explain the changes you have made.</li>
<li>Modify the Javadoc<sup>TM</sup> comments and other appropriate documentation.</li>
<li>Build the software and verify your fix.</li>
<li>Run the relevant sanity/regression tests to make sure that the fix has not broken anything.</li>
</ol>

A <b>patch</b> is the set of differences between two versions of the same file. It is generated by running <pre>cvs diff</pre> 
which reports the differences between two versions of one or more files in the source tree. Patches are used to send someone the exact changes that were made to your version of a program or a document. The receiver of the patch can then apply it to their version of the source tree to merge the changes and bring their version up-to-date with your version. <i>All patches must be reviewed before adding them back to the source tree.</i>

<p>This is the process for submitting a patch file for review:

<ol>
<li>Create a patch file:
<ol type="a">
<li> % cd <i>checkedout_source</i></li>
<li> % cvs diff -u > <i>patch_report_name</i></li>
</ol> 

<p><li>Enter an issue in Issue Tracker that corresponds to the patch, if none exists.</li>
<p><i>Submit only one patch per issue. Do not submit a patch to fix more than one issue unless they are closely related.</i>
<p><li>Submit your patch along with the issue number to <a href="mailto:codereview@opensso.dev.java.net">codereview@opensso.dev.java.net</a>.</li>
<p><li>If approved, attach the patch file to the issue in Issue Tracker. This can be attached as a file or copied directly into the Suggested Fix field.</li>
<p><li>Send the approved patch to <a href="mailto:committers@opensso.dev.java.net">committers@opensso.dev.java.net</a> to have it applied to the source tree.</li>
<p><li>Once the patch is applied, the committer will update the issue in Issue Tracker as fixed.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have found a critical security issue, please follow the <a href="faqbugs.html">guidelines for filing critical security issues</a>. 
<p>If your patch is big or you intend to develop a product enhancement, you must follow the architecture review guidelines before submitting the patch. For more information, send an email to <a href="mailto:codereview@opensso.dev.java.net">codereview@opensso.dev.java.net</a>.
