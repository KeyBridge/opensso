             <h2>OpenSSO Governance Proposal - Draft</h2>
<p>The OpenSSO project follows a simple governance structure. <b>Decisions are made in public discussion groups</b> by <a href="http://en.wiki[edia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">consensus</a>. All decisions are made transparently and any member of the project may voice their concerns in the discussion.
</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome to join the OpenSSO community and make contributions. OpenSSO members follow the <u>code of conduct</u><a href="http://wikihome.sfbay.sun.com/OpenSSO/Edit.jsp?page=CodeOfConduct">?</a> and abide by the governance process.  OpenSSO members may play one or more of the following roles in the community.
</p>
<h3>User</h3>
<p>All OpenSSO project members are Users. Users use the software produced by the community. They file problem reports, enhancement requests and new feature request. They share their experiences in using the software with others in the community through forums, wiki and by publishing articles.
Become a user by creating a user id and just joining the community.  In opensso.java.net, request for <b>observer</b> role, which is equivalent to *User* role.
</p>
<h3>Developers</h3>
<p>Developers are Users, who also contribute code or documentation changes to resolve issues, to make feature enhancements, or to incorporate new features. Developers do not have write access to the source tree. 
To become a developer, complete and sign <a class="wikipage" href="http://wikihome.sfbay.sun.com/OpenSSO/Wiki.jsp?page=SunContributorAgreement">Sun Contributor Agreement</a>.  Once SCA is registered, Users will be notified about the same.  Please forward your registration note to sca@dev.opensso.java.net, if your role is not approved in two working days.  In java.net, request for <b>observer</b> role.  Observer role in opensso.java.net with SCA agreement signed is equivalent to Developer role.

</p>
<h3>Committers</h3>
<p>Committers are Developers with write acess to the source tree.  Committers review the patch submitted by the developers. Once the patch is approved by the committers and module owners, patch will be applied to the src tree by one of the committers. Most committers have write privileges to only part of the source tree that they are most familiar with.
Developers are considered for committer role based on the quality of their prior contributions to the project.  Expertise in one or more of the modules demonstrated through patches made to the src tree, contributions to the forums, and wiki.  In java.net, request for <b>developer</b> role, which is equivalent to Committer.
</p>
<h3>Module Owners</h3>
<p>Module owners are Committers, who are responsible for reviewing and maintaining the quality of the module.  They are also responsible for merging patches, and new code from the development branch of the source tree into the stable branch. Module owners are also responsible for making sure that these contributions do not break the build and perform second level review as well as architecture review of changes proposed.
Module owners are appointed by creating consensus among committers and module owners.  Module owners are initially appointed by Sun.  In java.net, request for <b>developer</b> role and <b>content developer</b> role.

</p>
<h3><a name="section-OpenSSOGovernanceProposal-ProjectManagers">Project Managers</a></h3>
<p>This Project Managers are responsible for managing the entire project, helping to create policies by consensus that ensure global quality.  Project managers are responsible for creating project branch of source tree.  Branches are created for sustaining, major enhancements, and experiments.  Project managers are also responsible for making any updates to governance policy. All decisions are made by driving consensus.  In cases where consensus could not be reached, project managers make the final decision.
Project Managers are appointed by Sun.  In java.net, request for <b>developer</b>, <b>content developer</b> and <b>project owner</b> roles.
